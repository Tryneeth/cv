## Technical Experience

* **Programming Languages**
  * **.NET Platform (C#, ASP, WebAPI)** This is my first class language. I have more than 8 years of experience using C# and I'm improving my skills on it every day. I have used Entity Framework for years and can code in .NET Framework up to 4.6 and in .NET Core 2.

  * **PHP:** I've used PHP for Web applications development using Worpress for Managing Content or Symfony and Laravel frameworks. and to write Android applications. I can write and deploy PHP applications from scratch and can learn new skills very fast.

  * **Angular:** This is my newest tool. I'm in love with this language and I'm wanting to start working with this professionally.

  * Also know **MSSQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Typescript**, **JavaScript** **MySQL**, **SASS**

* **Other Technologies**
  * **Docker:** Docker reduces the gap between the developer environment and the staging and production scenario. I've used Docker to test and deploy software and it's a technology I use almost everyday. I'm also familiar with docker-compose.
  * **git:** I use git everyday. I could not be able to work without it. Version control is very important to me and I believe in [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) way to do commits.
